-- performance_refactored.sql (No structural changes needed if indexes are correct)

-- The query structure remains the same, but its performance is expected to improve
-- significantly due to the presence of the following recommended indexes:
--   - idx_bookings_user_id (on bookings.user_id)
--   - idx_bookings_property_id (on bookings.property_id)
--   - idx_payments_booking_id (on payments.booking_id) -- Assuming you create this
--   - idx_bookings_check_in_date (on bookings.check_in_date) -- Or ensure existing idx_bookings_dates covers this

## SELECT
    b.booking_id,
    b.check_in_date,
    b.check_out_date,
    b.total_price AS booking_total_price,
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name AS user_first_name,
    u.last_name AS user_last_name,
    u.email AS user_email,
    p.property_id,
    p.title AS property_title,
    p.price AS property_base_price,
    pay.payment_id,
    pay.amount AS payment_amount,
    pay.payment_date,
    pay.status AS payment_status
FROM
    bookings AS b
INNER JOIN
    users AS u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
INNER JOIN
    properties AS p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN
    payments AS pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
ORDER BY
    b.check_in_date DESC;
Additional Index for Payments:

For the LEFT JOIN with payments, you would also need an index on payments.booking_id.

SQL

-- Add this to your database_index.sql if not already there
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_booking_id ON payments (booking_id);
Why the structure doesn't change much here:

The initial query is already well-formed for retrieving comprehensive booking data. The "refactoring" in this case primarily relies on the database optimizer making smarter decisions because of the presence of relevant indexes. The query itself is logically sound for the objective.

If more drastic refactoring were needed (e.g., for very specific, highly frequent queries):

Materialized Views: For complex reports run frequently, a materialized view could pre-calculate and store the result, refreshing periodically.

Denormalization: For extremely read-heavy scenarios, selectively duplicating some data could avoid joins, but this adds complexity to writes and data consistency.

Filtering Early: If the query had a WHERE clause that significantly reduced the number of bookings (e.g., WHERE b.check_in_date > '2025-01-01'), ensuring that filter is applied early (which the optimizer usually does) and is indexed is crucial.

After creating these indexes, re-run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on the exact same SELECT query. You should see marked improvements in Execution Time and changes in the EXPLAIN plan, indicating that Index Scans are being used instead of Sequential Scans, and Sort operations might be avoided or become much faster.

Do you have a specific database system in mind (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server) that might influence the EXPLAIN output interpretation or index recommendations?
